# Features
* Automatically detect the current ocean fishing route and objectives.
* Tracks the required fish for achievements.
* Tracks the current time on the spectral current.
* Resets the spectral fish count when entering a new zone.

# Limitations and Bugs
* These triggers do use C# code. The code is used to calculate the current route. If you're worried about the code you can review it yourself in the [TriggernometryOceanFishing.cs](https://github.com/austinglines42/TriggernometryOceanFishing/blob/v1.0.1/TriggernometryOceanFishing.cs) file.
* Does not track players more than 20 yalms away.
* Does not track blue fish.
* Some jankyness can happen if you have a spectral that ends early into an early spectral.

# How to Install
